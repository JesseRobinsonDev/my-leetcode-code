If you are trying to learn how to effectively solve Leetcode problems
I suggest looking at https://neetcode.io/, I am working my way through the
Neetcode 150 (Blind Leetcode 75 with 75 extra problems)

I first learned how to code the Python solution, then, recreated the solution
In different languages while looking at the solution as little as possible

This project was to help me both learn the deeper intricacies of a language
And also get familiar with the solution used in the problems

I am considering building a website in the near future to display this code
In an easy to digest way, with a solution explanation
